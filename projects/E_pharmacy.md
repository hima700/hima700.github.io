The project is centered around the development of an E-pharmacy, aiming to create an efficient and user-friendly online platform for pharmaceutical services. As a team member, my primary responsibility revolved around the technical aspects, specifically in managing the project's infrastructure and deployment process.

I took charge of creating and updating the Docker image for the application. Dockerization is a crucial aspect of modern software development, as it allows for consistent deployment across different environments. Additionally, I handled the GitHub repository, overseeing branch management and ensuring collaborative development among team members. This included merging contributions, resolving conflicts, and maintaining a structured version control system.

The deployment of the application was done using Heroku, a cloud platform that streamlines the deployment process. This involved configuring the Heroku environment, managing dependencies, and addressing any deployment-related issues. Furthermore, my responsibilities extended to handling the database, ensuring seamless integration with the application and addressing data-related challenges.

Through this experience, I gained practical insights into the intricacies of creating Docker images, effectively managing a GitHub repository with multiple contributors, and deploying applications using Heroku. The project not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided valuable lessons in collaborative software development, version control, and troubleshooting in a real-world context. Overall, it was a comprehensive learning experience that bridged theoretical knowledge with hands-on application in the realm of software development.
