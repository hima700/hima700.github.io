FoodieFinders is an innovative web application tailored to enhance the dining experience for students at the University of Hawaii by providing real-time updates on menu availability at various dining venues across campus. As a member of the development team, my responsibilities were both in front-end and backend development, emphasizing a seamless user interaction and robust data handling.

For the front end, I utilized my skills in JavaScript and Meteor to create a dynamic and responsive interface that allows users to easily navigate through different food venues and menu items. I was involved in designing the UI/UX, ensuring that the application was intuitive and accessible on various devices, which is crucial for the on-the-go nature of student life.

On the backend, I integrated MongoDB to manage our data needs, setting up schemas to store and retrieve information efficiently about food items, vendors, and user interactions. This setup was crucial for supporting the real-time functionality of our app, where menu items needed to be updated instantaneously across the user base.

Additionally, I was responsible for the deployment of the application on Digital Ocean, ensuring optimal configuration and performance scalability under varying loads. This included setting up the server environment, configuring DNS settings, and monitoring the system for any potential issues.

This project not only honed my technical skills in full-stack development but also enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively within a team and manage multiple aspects of a software project, from initial development to deployment and maintenance.
